# MuseScore Plugin: Color Halfstep Notes Upgraded
musescore | piano | music

## Download

I modified a plugin that can paint all black key notes red. Now the plugin will paint sharp notes red and flat notes blue.

I just start learning playing piano. This plugin helps me reduce the mental burden to deal with different key signatures.
