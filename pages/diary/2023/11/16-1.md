# Won a candy jar 
life | game

I won the candy corn guessing contest hosted by the leasing office. The prize is exactly the jar I was guessing, and the candies there : D

I guessed 250 candies. I caught the area occupied by ten candies, and then extended it to the entire jar. I initially guessed that there were about 150 to 200. But by experience my estimate must be too small, so I finally chose 250.
